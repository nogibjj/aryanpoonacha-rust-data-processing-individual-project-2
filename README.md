# Individual Project 2 for IDS 706

## Rust Data Processing

This repository contains a collection of Rust scripts for data extraction, transformation, loading, and querying. The scripts interact with a SQLite database and a CSV file.

### Scripts

#### 1. `extract.rs`

This script downloads a CSV file from a specified URL and saves it to a local directory. It uses the `reqwest` crate for HTTP requests and the `tokio` crate for asynchronous programming.

To run this script, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin extract
```

#### 2. transform_load.rs
This script reads data from a CSV file and loads it into a SQLite database. It uses the csv crate to read CSV files and the rusqlite crate to interact with SQLite databases.

To run this script, use the following command:

```
cargo run --bin transform_load
```

#### 3. query.rs
This script queries the SQLite database and prints the cars with the most horsepower. It uses the rusqlite crate to interact with SQLite databases.

To run this script, use the following command:

```
cargo run --bin query
```

### Utilizing GitHub Copilot

Throughout the development of these scripts, GitHub Copilot was used as an AI pair programmer. It provided suggestions for completing lines or blocks of code, which were particularly helpful for writing complex SQL queries and handling edge cases in data processing. It also suggested improvements in code structure and organization, leading to more readable and maintainable code.

### Dependencies
This project uses several dependencies, including openssl, reqwest, tokio, csv, and rusqlite. Make sure to add these to your Cargo.toml file.

### Setup
Before running the scripts, make sure to install Rust and Cargo on your system. You can download them from the official Rust website.

Then, you can run the scripts as described above.
